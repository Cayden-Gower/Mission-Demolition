# Mission-Demolition
## By: Cayden Gower & Braden Barber

Mission Demolition is a game similar to the Angry Birds mobile game.
Chapter 29 of our Intro to Game Design book by Jeremy Gibson Bond walks us through creating this game.

To add to the game, I downloaded Unity Assets to give the walls a new texture, as well as adding a sound for when 
a projectile is launched, and a sound for while the ball is flying through the air. I also added a castle to the winning
screen rather than just a blank screen with a button to restart.
